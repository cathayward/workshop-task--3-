### workshop task notes:

- i decided that i wanted to create a sketch that randomly picked and added an image of a companion from the game baldurs gate 3 every time the mouse is clicked.
- i had to look a little further into the idea of the randomIndex, and floor functions but they were simple enough to understand quickly
- once i had run the code a few times i noticed that the images were not appearing in the top left of the canvas and fixed it by adding the imageMode(CENTER) function which fixed it immediately
- once i had this all set up it was time to decide different ways to distort the images, as well as generating a random image when the mouse is clicked, i also wanted a random filter to be applied to the image
- this was quite a difficult task to achieve but i eventually got through it with the help of google and chatGPT
- i created a new array for the filters but couldn’t quite figure out how to actually apply the filters to the images
- i tried to google it but it seemed like a rather specific request so i asked chatGPT
- with some trial and error it gave me the idea to use ‘case’, ‘break’, and ‘default’, it also simplified my code with the switch function so that the code was more concise than the numerous ‘if’ statements i had previously
- after running it a couple of times i realised that i didn't like what the opaque filter did to the images and composition so i removed it entirely to hopefully create a better product
- i ran into an issue with my github page as there was a black box displaying in the corner of my sketch that isnt there inside my editing software preview, i tried to remove the background to see if that helped but it didn't see to resolve the issue
- after deleting and reuploading my whole repository a lot of the issues i was having seemed to be fixed, it's a bit of an unorthodox solution but it seemed to work
